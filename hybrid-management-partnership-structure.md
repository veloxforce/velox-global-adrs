# Hybrid Management Partnership Structure for Operational Scaling

## Status

**Proposed** | Date: 2025-07-27

## Context

- Partnership currently operates with single founder handling all functions (strategy, operations, sales, delivery)
- Business growth targets require operational scaling beyond personal capacity constraints
- Two distinct founder skill sets: AI-enhanced strategic thinking vs traditional human team management
- Current operational bottleneck preventing achievement of growth and revenue targets

## Decision

We will implement a hybrid management partnership structure that separates strategic and operational leadership based on founder strengths.

**Partnership Role Division:**

| Role | Owner | Responsibilities |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **AI Strategy Engine** | Marius | Client requirements, research, solution architecture, AI agent management |
| **Human Operations Manager** | Dirk | Human team building, project execution, delivery management |
| **Revenue Converter** | Roman | Sales calls and closing, contract negotiation, deal conversion |

**Management Integration Model:**
- Strategic decisions flow from AI Strategy Engine to operational execution
- Human Operations Manager maintains team coordination and project delivery
- Revenue Converter handles all client-facing sales activities and closing
- Weekly integration meetings ensure alignment across all three functions

## Consequences

### ✅ Positive
- **Leveraged Strengths**: Each partner focuses on their natural skill set
- **Scalable Operations**: Operational management can scale human team without strategic founder bottleneck
- **Revenue Focus**: Dedicated sales function improves conversion rates and deal velocity
- **AI-Enhanced Strategy**: Strategic thinking enhanced by AI tools remains competitive advantage

### ❌ Negative
- **Coordination Overhead**: Three-way partnership requires more structured communication
- **Role Dependencies**: Strategy Engine success depends on Operations Manager execution quality
- **Revenue Risk**: Revenue Converter effectiveness directly impacts business sustainability

### ⚪ Neutral
- Partnership profit sharing may need adjustment based on actual contribution values
- Role definitions will evolve based on business growth and partner performance
