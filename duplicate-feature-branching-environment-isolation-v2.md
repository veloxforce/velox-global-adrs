# DEVELOPMENT-001: Implement Feature Branching Workflow with Complete Environment Isolation

## Status
**Accepted** | Date: 2025-07-26

## Context
- Development teams need stable production environments while maintaining development velocity
- Shared infrastructure between environments creates resource contention and production stability risks
- Manual coordination between developers becomes overhead when environments share services
- Testing in production-like environments requires realistic resource allocation and data isolation
- Emergency production access must be balanced with code review requirements for quality
- Modern GitHub rulesets provide superior branch protection compared to legacy branch protection rules
- Organizations need "set once, forget forever" workflow patterns that scale across projects

## Decision
We will implement a two-environment architecture with production isolation and feature branching workflow aligned to environment promotion.

**Environment Architecture:**
```
Staging Environment (Shared Development)    Production Environment (Isolated)
├── backend-staging                         ├── backend-prod
├── frontend-staging                        ├── frontend-prod
└── database-staging                        └── database-prod

Developers share staging environment
Complete production isolation
```

**Git Workflow Integration:**
```
Feature Development → Staging Integration → Production Deployment

1. CREATE FEATURE
   ├── Branch from staging: git checkout staging && git checkout -b feature/new-capability
   ├── Develop against shared staging environment (backend-staging, database-staging)
   └── Push feature branch: git push origin feature/new-capability

2. INTEGRATE & TEST
   ├── Create PR: feature/new-capability → staging
   ├── Test in staging environment
   └── Stakeholder review and approval

3. DEPLOY TO PRODUCTION
   ├── Merge approved staging → main branch
   └── Production deployment from main branch
```

**GitHub Rulesets Configuration:**

| Branch | Enforcement | Required Reviews | Bypass Access | Additional Rules |
|--------|-------------|------------------|---------------|------------------|
| **main (Production)** | Active | 1 approval | No bypass allowed | Linear history, Deletion protection |
| **staging (Integration)** | Active | 1 approval | Admin/Maintainer bypass | Deletion protection |
| **feature/* (Development)** | None | Direct push allowed | All developers | No restrictions |

**Implementation Specifics:**
- **Service Naming Convention:** `{service}-{environment}` (e.g., `backend-staging`, `database-prod`)
- **Environment Isolation:** Complete separation between staging and production environments
- **Shared Development:** Developers collaborate using shared staging environment resources
- **GitHub Rulesets:** Configure modern rulesets instead of legacy branch protection rules
- **Access Control:** Admin bypass on staging for urgent fixes, no bypass on production

## Consequences

### ✅ Positive
- **Zero Production Risk:** Development and staging activities cannot impact production systems
- **Production Isolation:** Production environment operates independently from development activities
- **Simplified Operations:** No manual coordination required between staging and production
- **Shared Development:** Developers collaborate efficiently using shared staging resources
- **Data Isolation:** Prevents production data contamination from development activities
- **Standard Git Workflow:** Feature branches → staging → production follows industry practices
- **Modern Protection:** GitHub rulesets provide superior transparency and layering capabilities
- **Emergency Access:** Admin bypass on staging for urgent fixes while protecting production

### ❌ Negative
- **Configuration Complexity:** Two environment configurations require maintenance overhead
- **Resource Requirements:** Separate staging and production environments increase infrastructure costs
- **Learning Curve:** Team adaptation to shared staging workflow and access patterns

### ⚪ Neutral
- **Documentation Updates:** Existing deployment guides require revision for new workflow
- **Monitoring Adjustments:** Need to track environment-specific health and performance

## Alternatives Considered

| Alternative | Rejection Reason |
|-------------|------------------|
| **Shared Services with Manual Coordination** | Maintains production risk and requires ongoing coordination overhead |
| **Three-Environment Strategy (Dev + Staging + Production)** | Increases infrastructure complexity and costs without significant benefit |
| **Legacy Branch Protection Rules** | Limited transparency, no rule layering, requires admin access to view rules |
| **Single Environment with Feature Flags** | Increases application complexity and doesn't address resource contention |
