# Feature Branching Workflow with Complete Environment Isolation

## Status
**Accepted** | Date: 2025-07-26

## Context
- Development teams need stable production environments while maintaining development velocity
- Shared infrastructure between environments creates resource contention and production stability risks
- Manual coordination between developers becomes overhead when environments share services
- Testing in production-like environments requires realistic resource allocation and data isolation
- Emergency production access must be balanced with code review requirements for quality
- Modern GitHub rulesets provide superior branch protection compared to legacy branch protection rules
- Organizations need "set once, forget forever" workflow patterns that scale across projects

## Decision
We will implement a two-environment architecture with production isolation and feature branching workflow aligned to environment promotion.

**Environment Architecture:**
```
Staging Environment (Shared Development)    Production Environment (Isolated)
├── backend-staging                         ├── backend-prod
├── frontend-staging                        ├── frontend-prod
└── database-staging                        └── database-prod

Developers share staging environment
Complete production isolation
```

**Git Workflow Integration:**
```
feature/new-feature → staging → main → production
     │                  │       │         │
     │              Auto deploy  │    Auto deploy
     │                  │       │         │
Development      Staging Env    │    Production Env
Testing          Integration    │    Live System
                                │
                         GitHub Rulesets
                         - Require PR review
                         - Run CI checks
                         - Block direct pushes
```

**Branch Protection Strategy:**
- **Feature branches**: Development work, deploy to staging on PR
- **Staging branch**: Integration testing environment, shared by team
- **Main branch**: Production-ready code with full GitHub ruleset protection
- **Emergency access**: Direct main branch push for production hotfixes (logged and audited)

## Consequences

### ✅ Positive
- **Production Stability**: Complete environment isolation prevents development work from affecting production
- **Development Velocity**: Staging environment allows rapid iteration without production risk
- **Quality Assurance**: GitHub rulesets enforce code review and CI checks before production
- **Scalable Workflow**: Pattern works consistently across multiple projects and team sizes

### ❌ Negative
- **Resource Overhead**: Maintaining two complete environment stacks increases infrastructure costs
- **Environment Drift**: Staging and production environments may diverge over time without careful management
- **Coordination Complexity**: Shared staging environment requires team coordination for testing

### ⚪ Neutral
- Database migration strategy must account for both staging and production schema changes
- CI/CD pipeline complexity increases with dual environment deployment targets
