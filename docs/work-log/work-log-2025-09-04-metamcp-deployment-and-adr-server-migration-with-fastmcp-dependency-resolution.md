# Work Log: MetaMCP Deployment and ADR Server Migration with FastMCP Dependency Resolution

## 2025-09-04

**Worked on**: MetaMCP deployment to VELOXFORCE-ROOT with ADR server migration and FastMCP dependency resolution planning

**Context**: 
- **Trigger**: Priority 3 from MCP server system work log - elevated remote MetaMCP hosting for universal AI agent access
- **Why it matters**: Enable standardized organizational MCP server infrastructure without local setup complexity across company projects

**What I did**:
- Successfully deployed MetaMCP to VELOXFORCE-ROOT server via Docker Compose at meta.veloxforce.dev with automatic SSL
- Configured Caddy reverse proxy with conf.d pattern for subdomain access following established ADR-001 workflow
- Created velox-mcp-servers repository (https://github.com/veloxforce/velox-mcp-servers) with standardized FastMCP + UV approach
- Migrated velox_adr_server.py to structured adr-server/ directory with fastmcp.json dependency configuration
- Root cause analysis revealed MetaMCP container missing FastMCP causing server connection failures
- Established strategic plan to fork MetaMCP to veloxforce organization for FastMCP integration and future customization
- Created ADR-009 documenting MetaMCP adoption decision for organizational MCP server hosting

**Current state**: MetaMCP fully deployed and accessible at meta.veloxforce.dev, velox-mcp-servers Git repository created with ADR server migrated locally, exact issue is updating remote URLs to complete the deployment workflow

**Next session**: 
1. **Priority 1**: Debug GitHub caching issue - Python requests vs curl content mismatch preventing metadata from appearing
2. **Priority 2**: Establish ADR numbering/context system for multi-project scalability (separate per-project, show only relevant ADRs dynamically)  
3. **Priority 3**: Set up remote hosting on VPS with MetaMCP deployment for universal access
4. **Priority 4**: Define ADR lifecycle process (Proposed → Accepted → Deprecated workflow)

**Blockers**: None - ready to execute MetaMCP fork and FastMCP integration implementation plan
