# Work Log: ADR System Phase 1-2 Completion and Production Readiness
## 2025-09-06

**Validated Technical Actions:**
- Deleted 5 confirmed duplicate ADR files and replaced 2 originals with better versions  
- Added YAML frontmatter with accurate descriptions to 10+ ADR files extracted from actual Context sections
- Created troubleshooting documentation for MCP cache refresh limitation at `docs/troubleshooting/mcp-cache-refresh-limitation.md`
- Built `/find-document` command following ADR standards (Stage 2 with hardcoded velox-adrs server)
- Tested MCP session refresh behavior confirming fresh session requirement for cache updates
- Added troubleshooting route to CLAUDE.md navigation

**Verified Business Context:**
- **Trigger**: Phase 1-2 of ADR production readiness workflow completion
- **Requirements**: Transform ADR system from setup to production-ready with real-world usage capability
- **Timeline**: User will test via call_your_stars project in separate chat with continuous improvement approach

**Confirmed Current State:**
- ADR system operational: velox-adrs MCP server successfully serving content
- Repository contains 17 total ADRs with content migration complete
- MCP discovery working: 14 of 17 ADRs show meaningful descriptions (82% success rate)
- Infrastructure proven: GitHub integration, MCP protocol, and content accessibility verified
- Cache behavior documented: Fresh Claude Code session required for YAML frontmatter updates

**Approved Next Session:**
- Phase 3 testing via call_your_stars project in separate session  
- Filter CLAUDE.md from MCP server listings (navigation file shouldn't appear in content)
- Add YAML frontmatter to remaining 2 ADRs: `hierarchical-field-selection-business-intelligence.md` and `manual-data-extraction-period-aligned-analysis.md`
- Monitor real-world usage patterns and improve based on practical feedback

**Identified Blockers:**
- None - infrastructure operational, content accessible, clear path to 100% description coverage

**Validated Links/References:**
- **Next Session Critical Files**: 
  - MCP server configuration for CLAUDE.md filtering
  - `hierarchical-field-selection-business-intelligence.md` and `manual-data-extraction-period-aligned-analysis.md` for YAML addition
  - `/Users/verdant/.claude/commands/find-document.md` for usage testing
- **Key Files Modified**:

  - `docs/troubleshooting/mcp-cache-refresh-limitation.md` (new)
  - `CLAUDE.md` (troubleshooting route added)
  - `/Users/verdant/.claude/commands/find-document.md` (new)
- **Repository Status**:
