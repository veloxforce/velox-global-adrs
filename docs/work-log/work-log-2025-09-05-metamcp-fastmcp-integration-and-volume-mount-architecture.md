# Work Log: MetaMCP FastMCP Integration and Volume Mount Architecture

## 2025-09-05

**Validated Technical Actions:**
- Switched MetaMCP from external Docker image to local build context (`image: → build: .`)  
- Added FastMCP CLI installation to Dockerfile using `uv tool install fastmcp`
- Configured volume mount `/home/shared/projects:/projects:ro` in docker-compose.yml
- Forked MetaMCP to `veloxforce/metamcp` repository for organizational control
- Successfully resolved FastMCP execution errors (`spawn uvx ENOENT` → working uvx at `/usr/local/bin/uvx`)
- Fixed file access issues (`File not found: server.py` → accessible at `/projects/[project]/server.py`)
- Created ADR-010 documenting volume mount architectural decision
- Verified MetaMCP can now execute MCP servers with `uvx fastmcp run /projects/[path]/server.py`

**Verified Business Context:**
- **Trigger**: Continuation of MetaMCP deployment work from 2025-09-04 work log
- **Requirements**: ADR server integration needed for organizational AI context distribution
- **Timeline**: Goal to start using ADR server operationally next week
- **Foundation**: OAuth integration improvements planned as future development on this foundation

**Confirmed Current State:**
- MetaMCP deployment functional with FastMCP CLI capabilities
- Container can access and execute MCP servers from host projects directory
- ADR server files located at `/projects/mcp-servers/adr-server/server.py` ready for integration
- Architecture documented for future development continuation
- Technical foundation complete for ADR server deployment

**Approved Next Session:**
- **Primary focus**: Technical deployment of Velox ADR server through MetaMCP
- Deploy ADR server and verify operational functionality
- User will provide additional specifications for ADR server requirements in next session
- Clean up and configure ADR content as needed

**Identified Blockers:**
- None - technical foundation complete, ready for ADR server deployment
