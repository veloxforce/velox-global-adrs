# Work Log: ADR System Production Readiness
## 2025-09-06

**Validated Technical Actions:**
- Resolved FastMCP container EACCES permission errors by identifying PATH vs installation issues
- Updated ADR-003 with container deployment patterns and troubleshooting guidance
- Fixed fastmcp.json schema validation errors (missing "source" object structure)
- Corrected path resolution issues using absolute paths in container environments
- Migrated 11 ADRs from Downloads/DEPLOYMENT to velox-global-adrs with descriptive naming
- Marked 6 files as duplicates with "duplicate-" prefix for review
- Established git workflow on adr-flat-migration branch with proper commits

**Verified Business Context:**
- **Trigger**: User requested transition from ADR system setup to production usage with real data
- **Requirements**: Prepare ADR system for real-world project integration with clean, standardized content
- **Timeline**: 3-phase approach with no additional feature development complexity

**Confirmed Current State:**
- ADR server operational: "Velox ADR Server (GitHub)" running on FastMCP 2.12.2
- Repository contains 23 total ADRs (17 unique + 6 marked duplicates)
- Infrastructure proven working: volume mounts, dependency installation, MCP discovery
- Content migration complete but requires standardization before production use

**Approved Next Session:**
- Phase 1: Manual duplicate review of 6 duplicate-prefixed ADRs
- Phase 2: Batch format standardization to README.md pattern across all ADRs
- Phase 3: Connect target project to MCP server, verify content retrieval functionality

**Identified Blockers:**
- None - infrastructure operational, content accessible, clear 3-phase path defined

**Validated Links/References:**

  - `duplicate-*` files in velox-global-adrs for Phase 1 review
  - `README.md` standardization pattern for Phase 2 formatting
