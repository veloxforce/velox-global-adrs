# Work Log: ADR Flat Migration and FastMCP Container Fixes
## 2025-09-06

**Validated Technical Actions:**
- Fixed FastMCP configuration issues in MetaMCP container (absolute path resolution, permission errors with uvx vs fastmcp execution)
- Updated ADR-003 with container deployment patterns, troubleshooting table, and corrected JSON schema format
- Migrated 11 ADRs from Downloads/DEPLOYMENT to velox-global-adrs repository with descriptive naming
- Renamed existing ADRs to remove numerical prefixes (001-adopt-universal â†’ universal-plant-engineering-principle.md)
- Marked 6 duplicate ADRs with "duplicate-" prefix for later resolution (AI workflows, Caddy patterns, Supabase schemas)
- Created migration branch "adr-flat-migration" and pushed changes to GitHub

**Verified Business Context:**
- **Trigger**: User requested transition from ADR system setup to production use with real organizational data
- **Requirements**: Consolidate universal ADRs for organizational knowledge distribution via MCP protocol

**Confirmed Current State:**
- 23 total ADRs in velox-global-adrs repository (17 unique + 6 marked duplicates)
- ADR server operational (Velox ADR Server running on FastMCP 2.12.2)
- Migration complete with flat structure and descriptive naming convention
- Container deployment working with corrected fastmcp.json configuration (absolute paths resolved)

**Approved Next Session:**
- De-duplicate content (merge or remove duplicate-prefixed files)
- Standardize all ADRs to README.md format (YAML frontmatter + Status/Context/Decision/Consequences structure)
- Test ADR server integration with real project
- Focus on making current content production-ready without adding new features

**Identified Blockers:**
- None - infrastructure ready, content cleanup needed before production use

**Validated Links/References:**
- **Next Session Critical Files**: 
  - `duplicate-*.md` files (6 files requiring merge/removal decisions)
  - `README.md` (standardized format specification)
  - `/ADR/` folder (project-specific ADRs to keep separate)
- **Key Files Modified**: 
  - ADR-003 updated with container patterns and troubleshooting
  - fastmcp.json corrected with absolute paths
  - 11 new ADRs from Downloads/DEPLOYMENT migration
- **Task Context**: ADR system production readiness for organizational knowledge distribution
